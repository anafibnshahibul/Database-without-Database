## 📊 Google Form Integration (The Core Database)
*This is the most powerful feature. It turns a simple Google Form into your backend database, storing all orders and messages directly into a Google Sheet.*

### Step-by-Step Configuration:
1. **Create a New Form:** Go to [Create a Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/create) and start a blank form.
2. **Add Your Fields:** Create Short Answer fields for the data you want to collect (e.g., `Customer Name`, `Phone Number`, `Selected Plan`, `Total Amount`).
3. **Get the Form Action URL:** - Preview your Google Form.
   - Right-click and select `Inspect`.
   - Press `Ctrl+F` and search for `<form action="`.
   - Copy that URL (it usually ends with `/formResponse`). Paste it into your project's configuration file.
4. **Find the Entry IDs:** Every input field in Google Forms has a secret ID that looks like `entry.123456789`. 
   - **Magic Tool:** To make this incredibly easy, go to our official ID Finder Tool: `[YOUR_ID_FINDER_TOOL_URL_HERE]`
   - Just paste your Google Form's source code there, and it will automatically extract all the `entry.ID`s for you!
5. **Connect:** Paste these `entry.ID`s into the JavaScript file as instructed in the inline comments.

## 📧 EmailJS Integration (Direct to Inbox)
*If you prefer getting an email notification every time someone submits a form or buys a service, use this module.*

### Step-by-Step Configuration:
1. **Sign Up:** Create a free account at [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/).
2. **Add Email Service:** Go to "Email Services" and connect your Gmail or Outlook account. You will get a `Service ID`.
3. **Create a Template:** Go to "Email Templates" and design how you want the email to look. Use variables like `{{name}}` or `{{phone}}`. Save it and copy the `Template ID`.
4. **Get Public Key:** Go to "Account" -> "API Keys" and copy your `Public Key`.
5. **Update the Code:** Open the EmailJS HTML/JS file in this project. Find the clearly marked section at the top and paste your `Service ID`, `Template ID`, and `Public Key`.

## WhatsApp Checkout Bridge
*Perfect for instant communication! This module takes the customer's order details and redirects them directly to your WhatsApp with a pre-typed message.*

### Step-by-Step Configuration:
1. **Find the WhatsApp Variables:** Open the WhatsApp configuration script in your editor.
2. **Set Your Number:** Look for the variable `const myWhatsAppNumber = "..."`. Enter your active WhatsApp number including the country code, but **without** any `+` or spaces (For example, for Bangladesh: `88017XXXXXXXX`).
3. **How it Works:** The JavaScript automatically grabs the input values (Name, Order ID, Price) and uses URL Encoding (e.g., turning spaces into `%20`) to create a secure `wa.me` link. 
4. **Testing:** No server needed! Just open the HTML file in your browser, fill in some dummy text, and click submit. It should immediately open WhatsApp Web or your mobile app.
